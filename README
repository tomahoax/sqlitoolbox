Warning
============

This extension doesn't correctly works standalone, before using it make sure that *ezxmlinstaller* is correctly installed and activated on the target instance

Introduction
============

This extension brings some useful features :
    - Display standard and custom log files directly from the back office (particularly useful when direct access to filesystem is not available)
    - Display generated .mail files (these files are generated when Transport is set to file in [MailSettings]
    - A quite basic interface to select and export content class definitions :
        - Export is generated in the XML format used by ezxmlinstaller extension,
        - An additional XMLInstallerHandler has been added to handle the ability to update a class (by adding/removing attributes)
        - Once generated the output XML file can be processed with this command :
         *Shell*
         ::
            php extension/ezxmlinstaller/bin/php/xmlinstaller.php --file=output.xml

Installation
============

  - Download the compressed file under *extension/* directory and uncompress it.
  - Activate the extension.
  - Clear the caches
  - Re-build the class autoload array :

  php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e -p


How to Use in the Backoffice
============================

  - Once correctly installed you should have a new *Toolbox* tab on the backoffice.
